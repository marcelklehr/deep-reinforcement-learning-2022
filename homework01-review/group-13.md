## Task 1
Your description of chess as a Markov Decision Process is easy to read and follow. Even though it is rather an informal description you correctly explain which elements the MDP consists of and how they can be defined.
As a small remark we wouldn't consider initial state as beeing optional in the case of chess.

## Task 2

Your description of the Lunar Lander environment as an MDP is similar to your first task. So also it isn't as formal as it could be. It is slightly shortcut as it omits definitions of the various state constituents. Nonetheless the MDP is well written and understandable and correct in the tasks broad sense.

## Task 3

Your definition is accurate and both of your examples helpful to understand the notion of environment dynamics.
The following discussion makes the problem of real world uncertaintys clear with help of practical usecases.
Well done!
