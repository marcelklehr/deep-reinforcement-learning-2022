Hi Group 27,

This is your feedback for homework number 1 :)
If you have any questions / remarks do not hesitate to contact us.

We liked that in task 1 you used a formal structure to describe the idea of the MDP.  Next to that, your idea with the min max algorithm was an appropriate option. For task 2, your content was correct as far as we understood it, however our impression was that the formal conventions you used have distanced yourself from the environment. Maybe 1, or 2 sentences in the beginning quickly giving the idea of the environment may help. Furthermore, the description of the environment dynamics was well explained in terms of examples (self-driving cars,...). Overall, well done :) 

Best wishes,

Group number 24
