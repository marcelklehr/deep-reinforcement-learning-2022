## Task 1
The description of chess as a Markov Decision Process is well written and sufficiently specific, even though it does not
satisfy the condition of being a formal description of the MDP, and is rather an informal description.
As an aside, it is our believe that chess is theoretically solved by using the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax), even though it is not practical to look ahead to the end of the game.

## Task 2

The description of the Lunar Lander environment as an MDP is slightly shortcut as it omits definitions of the various state constituents. Nonetheless it is well written and understandable.
The descriptions of MDP and policy do not satisfy our notion of a formal description, but are correct.

## Task 3

The definitions and the two examples are great. The discussion in the end is slightly cut short.

> The chess example also shows that sometimes, part of what determines the next state is funcitonally not possible to determine until after the action was taken.

Why would it need to be determined before the action was taken?
